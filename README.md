# RockPaperScissors
This is a TCP connection game between a java server and a python client.

## Execute instructions
First, the javaServer/RockPaperScissors should be executed first, then, the pythonClient/RockPaperScissors.py too... After that, enjoy the game :)

## Server
You can give the arguments es_ES, ca_ES, or default if you want to change the game idiom.
